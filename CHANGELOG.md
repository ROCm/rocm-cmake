# Change Log for rocm-cmake

## [(Unreleased) rocm-cmake 0.13.0 for ROCm 6.2.0]

### Changed

- ROCmCreatePackage: Accepts a suffix parameter, automatically generating it for static or ASAN builds.
  - Package names will no longer be pulled from `CPACK_<GEN>_PACKAGE_NAME`
  - Runtime packages will no longer be generated for static builds

## [rocm-cmake 0.12.0 for ROCm 6.1.0]

### Added

- ROCMTest: Add rpath to installed tests
- AOCMCreatePackage: Allow additional provides on header-only packages
- ROCMSphinxDoc: Allow separate source and config directories

### Changed

- Renamed CMake package to ROCmCMakeBuildTools. A wrapper has been provided
  to ensure that `find_package(ROCM)` continues to work, but it is recommended
  that developers switch to `find_package(ROCmCMakeBuildTools)`
- ROCMInstallTargets: Stopped installing executables in ASAN builds

### Resolved issues

- ROCMClangTidy: Resolved issues invalid list index in clang tidy
- Resolved issues test failures when `ROCM_CMAKE_GENERATOR` is an empty string

## [rocm-cmake 0.11.0 for ROCm 6.0.0]

### Changed

- ROCMSphinxDoc: Improved validation, documentation and rocm-docs-core integration.
- Rename CMake package to ROCmCMakeBuildTools

### Resolved issues

- ROCMClangTidy: Resolved issues extra make flags passed for clang tidy.
- ROCMTest: Resolved issues issues when using module in a subdirectory.

## [rocm-cmake 0.10.0 for ROCm 5.7.0]

### Added

- Added ROCMTest module
- ROCMCreatePackage: Added support for ASAN packages

## [rocm-cmake 0.9.0 for ROCm 5.6.0]

### Added

- Added the option ROCM_HEADER_WRAPPER_WERROR
  - Compile-time C macro in the wrapper headers causes errors to be emitted instead of warnings.
  - Configure-time CMake option sets the default for the C macro.

## [rocm-cmake 0.8.1 for ROCm 5.5]

### Changed

- ROCMHeaderWrapper: The wrapper header deprecation message is now a deprecation warning.

### Resolved issues

- ROCMInstallTargets: Added compatibility symlinks for included cmake files in `<ROCM>/lib/cmake/<PACKAGE>`.

## [rocm-cmake 0.8.0 for ROCm 5.4]

### Resolved issues

- ROCMCreatePackage: Resolved issues error in prerm scripts that could break package upgrades when using the `PTH` option.
- Removed unnecessary requirement for having C and C++ compilers available when building rocm-cmake from source.

### Known issues

- This release did not have a unique version number.

## [rocm-cmake 0.8.0 for ROCm 5.3]

### Changed

- `ROCM_USE_DEV_COMPONENT` set to on by default for all platforms. This means that Windows will now generate runtime and devel packages by default
- ROCMInstallTargets now defaults `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` to `lib` if not otherwise specified.
- Changed default Debian compression type to xz and enabled multi-threaded package compression.
- `rocm_create_package` will no longer warn upon failure to determine version of program rpmbuild.

### Resolved issues

- Resolved issues error in prerm scripts created by `rocm_create_package` that could break uninstall for packages using the `PTH` option.

## [0.7.3]

### Added

- Header wrapper functionality included. This is to support the change in header file locations in ROCm 5.2, while providing backwards compatibility via header file wrappers.
  The associated deprecation warning can be disabled by defining `ROCM_NO_WRAPPER_HEADER_WARNING` before including the wrapper header.

### Resolved issues

- Resolved issues spurious failures in `rocm_check_target_ids` for target ids with target features when `-Werror` is enabled.
  The `HAVE_<target-id>` result variable has been renamed to `COMPILER_HAS_TARGET_ID_<sanitized-target-id>`.

## [0.7.2]

- `rocm_create_package` now will attempt to set a default `CPACK_GENERATOR` based on the `ROCM_PKGTYPE` environment variable if one is not already set.

## [0.7.1]

### Added

- `CLANG_TIDY_USE_COLOR` variable added to control the color output from `clang-tidy`, by default this is `On`.
- If `CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` is not set, `rocm_create_package` will now automatically attempt to find a LICENSE, LICENSE.txt, or LICENSE.md file in the top-level CMake source directory. If one is found, it is set up as the license file for the package.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Component packaging functionality:
  - `rocm_package_setup_component` sets up a component for packaging, with the given name and values for the component and associated package.

    - The variable `ROCM_PACKAGE_COMPONENTS` stores a list of the components which have been set up with `rocm_package_setup_component`.
  - `rocm_package_add_rpm_dependencies` adds any number of dependencies to the RPM package for an optional specified component, including version checks (e.g. `foo >= 1.0`)
  - `rocm_package_add_deb_dependencies` adds any number of dependencies to the DEB package for an optional specified component, including version checks (e.g. `foo >= 1.0`)
    - Note that this version format matches RPM, it is reformatted to the Debian package format. This is to reduce code duplication.
  - `rocm_package_add_dependencies` is a convenience wrapper which calls both `rocm_add_rpm_dependencies` and `rocm_add_deb_dependencies` to add any number of dependencies to both packages for an optional specified component.
- Client packaging functions:
  - `rocm_package_setup_client_component` is a convenience wrapper which adds the library as a runtime dependency if shared libraries were built, and sets the parent of the client package to `clients`.
- Utility functions:
  - `rocm_join_if_set` joins any number of non-empty strings to the end of a given variable interspersed with a specified glue string, setting that variable if it was previously empty
  - `rocm_find_program_version` checks to see if the given command is available, and if it is available that the version matches some criteria. The detected version is returned in `<output_variable>`, and whether it matches all given criteria in `<output_variable>_OK`.
    - `<output_variable>` defaults to `<program>_VERSION` if not specified.

### Changed

- If `ROCM_PACKAGE_COMPONENTS` is set (either manually or by `rocm_package_setup_component`), then the components listed in `ROCM_PACKAGE_COMPONENTS` will be built as separate packages.
- `rocm_read_os_release` and `rocm_set_os_id` moved to the utilities file. As this file is included in `ROCMCreatePackage.cmake`, this change is backwards compatible.
- `rocm_install_symlink_subdir` now accepts a `COMPONENT` argument, which controls the component that the symlinks are installed into.

## [0.6.2]

### Changed

- If the ROCm platform version that is being built for is less than version 4.5.0, `ROCM_DEP_ROCMCORE` is automatically disabled.
  - The ROCm platform version is determined by:
    - the user-set CMake variable `ROCM_PLATFORM_VERSION`; otherwise
    - if the install prefix resolves to a path containing `rocm-<version>`, that version is used; otherwise
    - if the real path to the version of `rocm-cmake` used contains `rocm-<version>`, that version is used.
  - If the ROCm platform version is not set, then it is assumed to be greater than 4.5.0.

## [0.6.1]

### Added

- Modules added to generate documentation:
  - `ROCMDocs`
  - `ROCMDoxygenDoc`
  - `ROCMSphinxDoc`

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- `ADDONS` flag added to `rocm_enable_cppcheck` in order to run with addons
- The cache variable `ROCM_USE_DEV_COMPONENT` may be set to `OFF` to build with legacy behaviour.
  - On Windows, this variable defaults to `OFF`.
- `rocm_install_targets` can now install to a specific component using COMPONENT argument.
- `rocm_install` is a wrapper on `install`:
  - If the installation mode is TARGETS, call `rocm_install_targets` with the same arguments.
  - If `ROCM_USE_DEV_COMPONENT` is `OFF` or COMPONENT is specified, call `install` with the same arguments.
  - Otherwise, insert the correct arguments to install everything except libraries to the `devel` package, and install libraries to the base package with namelinks in the `devel` package.

### Changed

- If `ROCM_USE_DEV_COMPONENT` is `ON`:
  - `rocm_install_targets`:
    - Unless COMPONENT is specified, library targets will be installed to the default package and namelinked in the devel package.
    - Unless COMPONENT is specified, everything else (including any files/folders specified by INCLUDE) will be installed to the devel package.
    - If COMPONENT was specified in the call to `rocm_install_targets`, that component is used instead of the above behaviour.
  - `rocm_export_targets`:
    - All cmake files will be installed to the devel package.
  - `rocm_create_package`:
    - Package generation will be performed component-wise, and automatically include the devel component, even if the COMPONENTS argument was not provided.
    - If provided with the `HEADER_ONLY` option (accepting no arguments), then only the devel package will be generated. The devel package will also have the "Provides" field populated with the name/version of the runtime package for backwards compatibility. This provides field is introduced as a deprecated feature, and will be removed in a future release.
- Corrects semantic versioning to SameMajorVersion compatibility (e.g. 0.6 is compatible if 0.5 is requested).
- Moved ROCMConfigVersion.cmake file to share/rocm/cmake directory for better compatibility with automatic installation.
- Correct CHANGELOG.md formatting

## [0.5.1]

### Added

- Add ROCMConfigVersion.cmake file so cmake can check the version
- Switched to semantic versioning

## [0.5]

### Added

- Change Log added and version number incremented

## [0.4]
